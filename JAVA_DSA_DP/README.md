Dynamic Programming 

Basically, to solve the problem we are going to combine the solution of sub problems

overlapping we are trying to solve same sub problem again and again 

<!-- Approach to DP : -->

Memorization : When you compute something for the first time, you store it so that it can be reused and later on

Compute subproblems in correct order
